Reliable theoretical calculations of energy bands 
in the hybrid Quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method in the ecalj package

------------

Each directory contains input files, and energy band plot in QSGW.
To see energy band, 
>gnuplot -persist bnds.gnu
at each directory.

To reproduce the results from ctrls.* file (structure file. See our paper),
we need to run QSGW calculation step by step.

Steps are (in the case of gaas)
1. Write ctrls.gaas by hand (or converted from VASP, cif or so. There are tools for it).
2. Generate ctrl.gaas from ctrls.gaas by ctrlgenM1.py
3. Generate GWinput by mkGWIN_lmf2
(Finally, we need ctrl.gaas and GWinput. There two are only the requirement).
4. Run QSGW (time consuming), by a script gwsc
   >gwsc 5 -np 4 gaas
   , where 5 means 5+1 iterations
   (5 times is almost enough for semiconductors, but may need 15 times
   iteration for NiO). Before gwsc, run
   >lmfa gaas
   to prepare atomic core electron density. (spherical atom calculations).

   We finally get rst.gaas (electron density) and sigm.gass
   (self-energy). Both are used for the postprocessing process such as
   band plot
5. With rst.gaas sigm.gaas, and ctrl.gaas, in addition to symmetry
   line file syml.gaas (by hand; automated in future),
   we can make band plot by
   >job_band gaas  -np 4
   (in LDA simg.gaas is not necessary).
  
Above description is just very minimum explanation taken from the ecalj manual.
